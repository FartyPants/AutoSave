An auto save extension for text generated with the oobabooga WebUI.

If you've ever lost a great response or forgot the perfect prompt, AutoSave is for you!

- 100% offline
- Saves every prompt and every response to the host
- Creates a new file for every day
- Appends the prompt and response to the log file as JSON
- Logs are located in *PATH_TO_text-generation-webui/extensions/AutoSave/output/*

### How to use:

Fire up a command prompt | shell:

```cd PATH_TO_text-generation-webui/extensions```

Now clone this repo:

```git clone https://github.com/ill13/AutoSave```

Finally enable the extension in the *session* tab

### Future:

I may add the generation properties [model, seed, settings] at a later point.
